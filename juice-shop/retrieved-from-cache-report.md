# 🛡️Retrieved From Cache

- **Severity**: Informational Alert ⚠️
- **Location**: http://localhost:3000 🌐
- **Tool used**: OWASP ZAP 🛠️ 

---

## Description 📖

The HTTP respoonse was served from a cache instead of being freshly generated by the server. This is common for performance optimisation, but may have security implications in certain contexts.

Caching can cause issues when:
- sensitive data is stored or exposed in a shared/public cache.
- An attacker can manipulate cache keys or parameters to retrieve unauthorised data.
- Cache headers are misconfiguered, allowing caching of personalised content.

---

## Proof of concept 🧪

1. open OWASP ZAP and proxy traffic through firefox.
2. Visit 'http://localhost:3000' (OWASP Juice Shop running locally).
3. In ZAP, examine HTTP responses for a header like: X-cache: HIT or Age: 333806
4. These indicate that the response was retrieved from cache.

---

## Impact 🟥:

While not a direct vulnerability, cached responses could leak sensitive or user-specific information if:
- Cache settings are too broad (e.g. Cache-control: public on authenticated endpoints).
- Session identifiers or personal data are stored in cached pages.
- Application logic relies on real-time data.

---

## Recommendation 💻:

Review caching behaviour and headers. Specifically:
- Avoid caching sensitive user-specific data.
- Use cache headers like: Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, private.
- validate that caching is appropriate per resource.
